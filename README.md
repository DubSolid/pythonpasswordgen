# pythonpasswordgen
Password generator written in Python.

It also creates and stores passwords created in a file in the same directory, called "passwords.txt".


By changing the number at line 12 where it says "length", you can change the length of the string that will be printed out.
It looks like 98 characters is the limit for some reason.
